***Backend API for Todo List Application***

This Node.js backend application provides a RESTful API for managing a todo list. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and is connected to a MongoDB database to store and manage todo items. The API can be used in conjunction with a frontend application to handle various tasks associated with a todo list.

**Features**

**Create**: Add new todo items to the list.

**Read**: Retrieve existing todo items. Fetch a single todo or all todos.

**Update**: Modify the details of an existing todo item.

**Delete**: Remove a todo item from the list.
